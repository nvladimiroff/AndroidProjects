A collection of Android projects I did for my CIS470 class.

* Flashlight was our first app, and is just a basic app that changes the background color depending on what button you press.
* TacoApp is just an order form for a Taco delivery service. This app was to help learn about more complicated UIs.
* The Android Cooking eBook is an app that lets the user pick from a list of recipes. If the user touches the text, the app tells you what you need to make it, and if the thumbnail is touched, the app shows a high resolution photo of the dish.
* The Cookie Monster game simulates a battle between two cookies monsters. This app was mainly to learn how multiple background threads communicate together with the UI thread.
* The FoodRSS app downloads an RSS feed of recipes and displays them to the user. The user can touch a recipe to get more information if he or she wants.
